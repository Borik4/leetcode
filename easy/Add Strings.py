# Given two non-negative integers, num1 and num2 represented as string, return the sum of num1 and num2 as a string.
#
# You must solve the problem without using any built-in library for handling large integers (such as BigInteger). You must also not convert the inputs to integers directly.

class Solution:
    def addStrings(self, num1: str, num2: str) -> str:
        return str(int(num2)+int(num1))

p = Solution()
print(p.addStrings('11', "123"))
